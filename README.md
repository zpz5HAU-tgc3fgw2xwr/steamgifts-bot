# ü§ñ Steamgifts Bot

A feature-rich bot built with TypeScript to automate interactions on the Steamgifts platform. Designed for efficiency, modularity, and ease of use, this project brings a modern approach to managing giveaways and accounts with advanced automation capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Account Support**: Manage multiple accounts via a JSON configuration file.
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Intelligent request handling to avoid bans.
- **Headless Automation**: Utilize Puppeteer to interact with the Steamgifts website.
- **API Integration**: Leverage API calls wherever feasible for better performance.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Run the bot seamlessly in the background using Docker.
- **Extensible Design**: Built with TypeScript for modularity and future enhancements.

## üöÄ Project Knowledge Goals

- **Learn Efficient Browser Automation**: Implement headless browser control with Puppeteer.
- **Enhance Modular Design Skills**: Develop extensible and maintainable code with TypeScript.
- **Understand Throttling Techniques**: Apply intelligent rate limiting to simulate realistic usage patterns.
- **Master Deployment Strategies**: Containerize the project with Docker for efficient deployment.

## üì¶ Installation
